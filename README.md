## Course Description

Web Authoring 1 is an introductory course to authoring and publishing content for the web. Students learn to read, write, and speak HTML and CSS, as well as, study the past and present history of the web. Web Authoring 1 focuses on the basics of modern web design through a series of projects exploring type, color, image, and layout.

## Criteria for Credit

### Attendance

Come to class. Don’t miss class, but if you need to, let me know, in advance via Slack or email; *not* 10 or 15 minutes before the start of class, but at least an hour, if you can. I’ll do the same. *Thank-you.*

Also, if you’re *illin’* and need to stay home, you can still attend class, via Google Hangouts; watch the lecture, and check-in with me via Slack. I’m flexible, just let me know what’s going on, and let’s work remotely when it makes sense.

Bottom line, don’t miss more than six (6) classes; that’s missing 3 weeks of class, and will result in a lower grade by at least 20%. For example, with six (6) absences, an “A” (94–100%) becomes a “B-” (80–82%). And, if you think you may miss more than six (6) classes, consider dropping, else you may receive a final grade of No Credit (NC).
